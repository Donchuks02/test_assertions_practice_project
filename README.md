# test_assertions_practice_project

## Project Overview
This project is focused on practicing various assertion methods available in Python's `unittest` library. It includes tests designed to explore and demonstrate each assertion method by applying it in different scenarios.

## Goals
- To gain hands-on experience with all available `unittest` assertion methods.
- To understand when and how to use each assertion effectively.
- To build a foundational understanding of unit testing in Python.

## Project Structure
- **code/tests/**: Includes all test cases, with each assertion type explored individually.


## Assertion Methods Covered
This project covers the following `unittest` assertion methods:
- `assertEqual()`
- `assertNotEqual()`
- `assertTrue()`
- `assertFalse()`
- `assertIs()`
- `assertIsNot()`
- `assertIsNone()`
- `assertIsNotNone()`
- `assertIn()`
- `assertNotIn()`
- `assertIsInstance()`
- `assertNotIsInstance()`
- `assertAlmostEqual()`
- `assertNotAlmostEqual()`
- `assertGreater()`
- `assertGreaterEqual()`
- `assertLess()`
- `assertLessEqual()`
- `assertRegexpMatches()`
- `assertNotRegexpMatches()`
- `assertItemsEqual() `
- `assertDictContainsSubset()`
- `assertMultiLineEqual()`
- `assertSequenceEqual()`
- `assertListEqual()`
- `assertTupleEqual()`
- `assertSetEqual()`
- `assertDictEqual()`


Each assertion is tested in realistic scenarios to demonstrate its usage and to ensure comprehensive coverage of the assertion capabilities in `unittest`.
